# LeftCenterRight
* check recursion
  * chances of returning to original game state after x turns?
  * chances of centerPoints not having changed after x turns?
  * average number of turns for a loop?
* record full game transcript maybe done??
* which player is most likely to win? is it equal?
* distribution of centerPoints value at game end
* consolidate turn() and round() so that we don't have to change both functions maybe?
